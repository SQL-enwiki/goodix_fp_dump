Simple test program for the Goodix HTK32 Fingerprint reader present in the
Dell XPS13 9370.

In order to make the device work the user needs access to the USB node (e.g.
/dev/bus/usb/001/004); so either run the program with sudo, or add a udev
rule.

Assuming that the user is in the 'plugdev' group, something like the following
should work:

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="27c6", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5385", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev" TAG+="uaccess"
